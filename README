String Interoperability Experiments - Revision 1

This library is intended to be suitable for inclusion in the C++ standard
library or a standard library Technical Specification (TS).

Revision 1 reflects comments received from the C++ committee's Library
Working Group at the Portland meeting in the fall of 2012.

Includes support for the new C++11 character and string types.

Code is suitable for both C++03 and C++11 compilers.

Code is experimental and NOT SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION WORK.

To experiment with the library, various other boost libraries must be
available. Here is one way to create such a setup:

  cd boost-root/libs
  git clone git://github.com/Beman/string-interoperability.git interop
  cd ../boost
  mklink /d interop ..\libs\interop\include\boost\interop
  
As a confidence test, the following should build bjam, build various
libraries and then run the regression tests.

Windows (assumes bootstrap has been run):

  cd boost-root/libs/interop/test
  ..\..\..\bjam

POSIX-like systems (assumes bootstrap has been run):

  cd boost-root/libs/interop/test
  ../../../bjam
