String Interoperability Experiments 

Includes support for the new C++11 character and string types.

Code is suitable for both C++03 and C++0x compilers.

Code is experimental and NOT SUITABLE FOR PRODUCTION WORK.

To experiment with the library, various other boost libraries must be
available. Here is one way to create such a setup:

  git clone git://github.com/Beman/string-interoperability.git interop
  svn export --force http://svn.boost.org/svn/boost/trunk interop
  
As a confidence test, the following should build bjam, build various
libraries and then run the Boost.btree regression tests.

Windows:

  cd interop
  bootstrap
  cd libs\interop\test
  ..\..\..\bjam

POSIX-like systems:

  cd interop
  ./bootstrap.sh
  cd libs/interop/test
  ../../../bjam
