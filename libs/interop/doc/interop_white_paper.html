<h1>Unicode White Paper&nbsp; <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">(DRAFT)</span></h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>This paper explores reducing current frustrations programming Unicode aware 
applications in C++11 via additions to Boost and to the C++11 standard 
library aimed at reducing frustrations encountered when programming. There are two underlying assumptions:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>Breaking C++03 or C++11 compliant code is unacceptable.</p>

<p>Limiting the scope of proposed additions to interoperability, encoding, and 
conversion issues with existing standard library string types can markedly 
reduce user frustration at a very reasonable cost.</p>

</blockquote>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>Unicode support can be decomposed into two levels:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Level 1 deals only with character encoding. It corresponds roughly to 
  the Unicode support in C++0x.</li>
  <li>Level 2 addresses the deeper characteristics of Unicode characters. See 
  Mathias Gaunard's <a href="http://mathias.gaunard.com/unicode/doc/html/">
  Unicode project</a> as an example of level two Unicode support.</li>
</ul>

<p>This white paper is concerned only with Level 1. Issues are identified and 
solutions suggested. The solutions are intended to be suitable for Boost 
initially, and the next C++ standard eventually.</p>

<h3>Proof-of-concept implementation</h3>

<p>A &quot;proof-of-concept&quot; implementation of the solutions presented here is 
available at <span style="background-color: #FFFF00">...</span>.</p>

<h2>Motivating examples</h2>

<h3>&quot;Hello World&quot; using an Asian language should work</h3>

<blockquote>
  <pre>#include &lt;iostream&gt;
int main()
{
  std::cout &lt;&lt; U&quot;&#24744;&#22909;&#19990;&#30028;&quot;;   // error in C++11!
}</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>This code should 
&quot;just work&quot;, even though the type of <code>U&quot;&#24744;&#22909;&#19990;&#30028;&quot;</code> is <code>const 
char32_t*</code>, not <code>const char*</code>, as long as the encoding of <code>char</code> 
supports &#24744;&#22909;&#19990;&#30028;. </p>
<p>It does &quot;just work&quot; with the proof-of-concept implementation of this 
proposal. On Linux, with default <code>char</code> encoding of UTF-8,  execution 
produces the expected &#24744;&#22909;&#19990;&#30028; output. On Windows, the 
console doesn't support full UTF-8, so the output can be piped to a file or to a 
program which does handle UTF-8 correctly.</p>

<h3>String interoperability</h3>

<h3>Standard algorithms and other functions taking iterator arguments</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr">Functions taking const <i>character-type</i>* arguments</h3>
<h3 dir="ltr">Functions taking const <i>string-type</i>&amp; arguments</h3>
<h2>Issue 1: Missing UTF-8 character type</h2>

<p>There is no built-in character type that specifies UTF-8 encoding. Without 
such a type, neither template arguments nor function overloads have a way to 
specify a narrow character with UTF-8 encoding. This is a confusing 
inconsistency with char16_t and char32_t. It sends the message to users that 
UTF-8 encoding is a second class citizen of the C++ world.</p>

<p>Just as character types <code>char16_t</code> and <code>char32_t</code> 
provide the foundation for <code>u16string</code> and <code>u32string</code>, a 
character type for 8-bit UTF-8 encoded characters is required as the foundation 
for solutions to the other issues presented here.</p>

<h3>Proposed resolution</h3>

<p dir="ltr">Because type <code>unsigned char</code> is distinct from type <code>
char</code>, it can be hijacked as the UTF-8 encoded character type. The 
proof-of-concept implementation does this and it has been problem free.</p>

<h4 dir="ltr">C++ committee:</h4>

<blockquote>

<p dir="ltr">Option 1:&nbsp; Add a new character type <code>char8_t</code> 
specified to have UTF-8 encoding.</p>

<p>Option 2:&nbsp; Add a global namespace <code>typedef unsigned char char8_t;</code> 
to standard library headers dealing with characters.</p>

</blockquote>

<h4>Boost:</h4>

<blockquote>

<p>Assuming <code>boost::u16_t</code> and <code>boost::u32_t</code> are the 
Boost types for <code>char16_t</code> and <code>char32_t</code>, add:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <pre>namespace boost
{
  <code>typedef unsigned char  u8_t;
}</code></pre>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<h2>Issue 2: Missing UTF-8 string type</h2>

<p dir="ltr">There is no string type that specifies UTF-8 encoding. Without such 
a type, neither template arguments nor function overloads have a way to specify 
a narrow character string with UTF-8 encoding.</p>

<h3>Proposed resolution</h3>

<p>Provide:</p>
<blockquote>

<pre dir="ltr">namespace boost
{
  typedef std::basic_string&lt;boost::char8&gt; u8string;
}</pre>
</blockquote>

<h2>Issue 3: String types do not interoperate with each other</h2>

<p>This code does not currently compile:</p>
<blockquote>
  <pre>u32string s32;
s32 = &quot;foo&quot;;         // error!
u16string s16(s32);  // error!
wstring ws(s32.begin(), s32.end()); // error!</pre>
  <pre>void f(const string&amp;);</pre>
  <pre>f(s32);  //error!</pre>
</blockquote>
<p>The encoding of basic_string instantiations can be determined for 
the types under discussion. It is either implicit in the string's value_type or 
can be determined via the locale.&nbsp; See Boost.Filesystem V3 class path for 
an example of how such interoperability might be achieved.</p>
<p>Experience with Boost.Filesystem V3 class path has demonstrated 
that string interoperability brings a considerable simplification and 
improvement to internationalized applications, but that having to provide 
interoperability without the resolution of the issues presented here is a 
band-aid. It is being misused, too - users are passing around boost::filesystem::path objects simply to get string encoding interoperability!</p>
<p>Note: interoperability will be easier to specify, implement, and 
use if Issue 4 is resolved.</p>

<h3>Proposed resolution</h3>

<blockquote>

<p>Boost resolution????: Provide namespace boost string classes that derived 
from std::basic_string and add the additional functions necessary to provide as 
much interoperability as possible without breaking existing code if substituted 
for existing uses of std::basic_string.</p>

<p>Standard library resolution????: Add additional std::basic_string function 
overloadss 
as necessary to provide as much interoperability as possible without breaking 
existing code if substituted for existing uses of std::basic_string.</p>
</blockquote>
<h2>Issue 4: String types do not interoperate with I/O stream types</h2>
<p>See the motivating examples above.</p>
<h2>Issue 5: Conversion between character encodings is awkward</h2>
<p>Concerns revolve around std::codecvt, std::locale, 
std::wstring_convert, and other standard library conversion facilities:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Given <b><i>n</i></b> encodings, necessity of 
  providing <b>n<sup>2</sup></b> codecvt facets rather than <b>2n</b> codecs. 
  UTF-32 is the obvious choice for the common encoding to pass between codecs. 
  This is existing practice in C libraries like ICU.</li>
  <li>Interfaces don't work well with generic programming 
  techniques.</li>
  <li>Unnecessary creation of temporary strings, with 
  attendant memory allocations/deallocations.</li>
  <li>Complex, difficult to learn, and difficult to use std::codecvt interfaces.</li>
  <li>Intertwining of std::locale and code conversion, even when these 
  are implementation details that should be hidden from the application.</li>
  <li>Difficult to control error actions. Choices should include:<ul>
  <li>Throw exception.</li>
  <li>Replace offending character with default character. </li>
  <li>Replace offending character with specified character. Motivating example: 
  Filesystem's need to use a replacement character that is acceptable to the 
  Windows codepage. See Boost issue #5769.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
  </ul>
<h3>Proposed resolution</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Provide a boost library header inspired by the iterator adaptor approach to 
encoding conversion pioneered by John Maddock in boost/regex/pending/unicode_iterator.hpp:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>from_<b><i>X</i></b> and to_<i><b>X</b></i> iterator adaptor codecs to 
    and from UTF-32. Possibly implemented using ICU iterators for the less 
    common encodings.</li>
    <li>General composition support for combining a from_<b><i>X</i></b> and to_<b><i>X</i></b> 
    into a complete conversion adaptor.</li>
    <li>Specializations or overloads prepackaging the 25 char, wchar_t, char8_t, 
    char16_t, and char32_t complete conversion adaptors.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<h2>Issue 6: String type interoperability requires an excessive number of 
overloads</h2>
<p>Overloads or specializations are required for:</p>
<blockquote>
  <ul>
    <li>Other instances of the same type.</li>
    <li>Single characters.</li>
    <li>Single iterators to terminated strings.</li>
    <li>Single iterators to strings whose size is determined by a size argument.</li>
    <li>Iterator ranges.</li>
    <li>Further variations on the above, with additional arguments for position 
    or repeat count.</li>
  </ul>
</blockquote>
<p>Each of these then have to be repeated in template form for interoperability 
with other string types.</p>
